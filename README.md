# 6DofRigidBody
Simulink dynamical Model of a 6 degree of freedom rigid body with fixed mass.

The model requires as input the forces and moments applied on the rigid body along all three axes, and returns as output speed, attitude accelerations and position of the rigid body.

The model presents a mask in which it is possible to enter the initial conditions of the model and the fundamental parameters (mass and inertia matrix)
